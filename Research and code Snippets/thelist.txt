SPECIAL OR MISCELLANEOUS PROJECTS:
I work by the hour, so miscellaneous projects are welcome. Simply email or text me with your special requests so we can budget them in to our regular work routine. If we have to trade off – skip a room of your house in order to accommodate the special project, let me know which room(s) you are trading for.
WORK HOURS:
My normal workdays are Monday through Friday 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. I do work from a schedule and recommend the same time and weekday for your cleaning to create consistency and convenience for us both.
ALARM SYSTEMS & KEYS:
It is not necessary to be at home while I’m there cleaning. If you have an alarm, make sure I have the key code so I can disarm the alarm when I arrive, and set it again when I leave. I’ll need to know where you keep your house key.
RESCHEDULING:
Stuff is going to happen. At one point or another -- for whatever reason, one of us, you or me is going to need to reschedule our cleaning. Communication is key. Call, text or email as soon as you know there is a conflict and we’ll do our best to reschedule your cleaning at the next earliest convenience. I will do the same.
SICK POLICY:
If you or your children get sick with a contagious illness (i.e. the flu, a cold, pneumonia, chicken pox etc.) please call and reschedule your cleaning. Even though I disinfect your house, it is possible that I might transport germs to the next house or become sick myself. And to be fair to all of my customers I prefer to wait until you are well again. On my end, I may call in sick as well to protect you and your family.
SATISFACTION:
We aim to please. If for any reason, at any time you are not completely please call us immediately at  0220601100
PAYMENT: Paying with a credit/debit card, Cash are also fine and can be left on the kitchen counter
